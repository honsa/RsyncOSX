## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am the developer of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI which both are GUIÂ´s on the Apple macOS plattform for the commandline tool [rsync](https://github.com/WayneD/rsync). It is rsync which does the actual synchronize task, not the GUIÂ´s. The GUIÂ´s are only for setting parameters to rsync and make it easy to use rsync, which is a fantastic tool.

RsyncOSX and RsyncUI is **not** developed to be an easy to use synchronize and backup tool. The main purpose is to assist and ease the use of rsync to synchronize files on your Mac to remote FreeBSD and Linux servers. And of course restore files from those remote servers.

The UI of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI can for users who dont know rsync, be difficult or complex to understand. Using the applications requires some knowledge of rsync. The main objective is to ease the use of rsync, not teach macOS users how to use rsync. That is beyond the scope. Setting the wrong parameters to rsync can result in deleted data. Neither RsyncOSX nor RsyncUI will not stop you for doing so. That is why it is very important to execute a simulated run, --dry-run, and inspect what happens before a real run.

If you have installed **macOS Big Sur**, RsyncOSX is the GUI for you. If you have installed **macOS Monterey**, you can use both GUIÂ´s in paralell. Both GUIÂ´s are maintaned, so it is a matter of taste.

RsyncOSX is the only GUI which supports scheduling of task.
